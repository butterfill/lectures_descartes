  .notes Bennett mentions  something Turnbull says about Aristotle's science:
  p.notes.handout.show: :t
    Aristotelian physics ‘is reasonably effective for organizing bodies of knowledge. From the 
    perspective of modern physical and biological science, however, it is severely crippled by 
    its close linkage with what Wilfrid Sellars calls ‘the manifest image’, i.e. what is available 
    to us by means of our very limited sense organs. . . . The tie to entities known through 
    perception prevents access to—much less the discoveries of—modern physics (and, consequently, 
    chemistry and biology)’

    This is what Descartes saw,
    and that’s what he is trying to explain in the Meditations.
  .notes: :t
    The usefulness of extensive doubt “lies in freeing us from our preconceived opinions, 
    and providing the easiest route by which the mind may be led away from the senses.”
  .notes: :t
    In studying the Mediations, we can have a lot of fun with sceptical
    arguments involving dreams and demons,
    and other bits and pieces.
    These have been widely examined by philosophers,
    most quiet critical.
    What you must never forget is that Descartes’ fundamental 
    insight was correct---
    Adherence to Aristotelian physics is based on the assumption that 
    the model of the physical implicit in human sensory perception is
    the truest, most accurate model of the physical there is;
    and this assumption is incorrect.

  .handout \section{Against Resemblance}
  .handout Do sensory perceptions resemble their causes?
  p.notes.handout.show: :t
    ‘In putting forward an account of light, the first thing that I want to draw to your attention 
    is that it is possible for there to be a difference between the sensation that we have of it, 
    that is, the idea that we form of it in our imagination through the intermediary of our eyes, 
    and what it is in the objects that produces the sensation in us, that is, what it is in the flame 
    or in the Sun that we term ‘light’.’
  .notes.handout.ctd \citep[][p. 3 (AT 3)]{descartes:1998_world}
  p.right.grey-text The World (AT 3)

  p.notes.handout.show: :t
    ‘if words, which signify something only through human convention, are sufficient to make us think of
    things to which they bear no resemblance, why could not Nature also have established some sign
    which would make us have a sensation of light, even if that sign had in it nothing that resembled
    this sensation? And is it not thus that Nature has established laughter and tears, to make us read
    joy and sorrow on the face of men?’
  .notes.handout.ctd \citep[][p. 4 (AT 4)]{descartes:1998_world}

  p.notes.handout.show: :t
    ‘Do you think that, when we attend solely to the sound of words without attending to their
    signification, the idea of that sound which is formed in our thought is at all like the object that
    is the cause of it? A man opens his mouth, moves his tongue, and breathes out: I see nothing in all
    these actions which is in any way similar to the idea of the sound that they cause us to imagine.
    And most philosophers maintain that sound is only a certain vibration of the air striking our ears.
    Thus if the sense of hearing transmitted to our thought the true image of its object, then instead
    of making us think of the sound, it would have to make us think about the motion of the parts of the
    air that are vibrating against our ears.’

      ‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics; 
      these principles explain all natural phenomena, and enable us to provide quite certain demonstrations 
      regarding them’ (PP 2:64, CSM 1:247). 
   .notes Bennett Learning: ‘That plainly makes physics a part or a consequence of mathematics’
