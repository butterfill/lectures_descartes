    \emph{Overall Topic}:
    What, according to Descartes, is the relation between a sensory perception and the thing perceived?
  .notes.handout: :t
    \emph{Question for this Lecture}: 
    How can we acquire knowledge about the essential nature
    of the bodies located outside us?
  .notes.handout: :t
    \emph{Argument of this Lecture}: 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sensory perceptions provide only very obscure information about the essential nature of bodies.
    \item Therefore, we cannot acquire knowledge about the essential nature of the bodies located outside us through sensory perceptions alone.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Exercise}
    The diagram shows a thin curved metal tube.
    Imagine you are looking down the tube.
    A metal ball is put into the end of the tube indicated by the arrow.
    The ball is then shot out of the other end of the tube at high speed.
    Please draw the past the ball will follow after it comes out of the tube \citep{mccloskey:1980_curvilinear}.

    Later: Also use Freyd representational momentum: it is based on sensroy erros!]
