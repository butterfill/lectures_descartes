    \emph{Overall Topic}:
    What, according to Descartes, is the relation between a sensory perception 
    and the thing perceived?

          This is all by way of a demonstration that Descartes was right.
          Sensory perceptions really do provide only very obscure information about the essential nature of bodies.

    //-     Just one small problem: how are we going to answer this question?
    //-   .notes: :t
    //-     Plan:
    //-     1. leave question hanging for now.
    //-     2. next lecture: come back and make similar points by appeal to intro to The World (on feather)
    //-     3. then: discuss relation of sensory perceptions to its objects (Simmons)
    //-     4. then: return to the question (Descartes’ answer: through mathematics)
    //-     5. Why is this the right way to start? Metaphysics as root of physics; method of doubt
    //-     used to show that sensory perceptions unreliable, whereas pure intellect is reliable.

        have argued that Descartes is right but not considered his reasons yet.
        [yyrama task is: 
        Why did Descartes hold that sensory perceptions provide only very obscure information 
        about the essential nature of bodies?]

//- arguments in The World against the senses:
+insert_unit({unit:'light_and_sound', title_slide:true, images:images, handout:true})
//- arguments in Meditation 1 against the senses:

      .notes: :t
        Considered the search for arguments about this claim.
        First, it is true (representational momentum).
        Second, Descartes provides some good arguments for it in The World.
        Third, Descartes’ arguments in the First Meditation are harder to discern ...
        and that’s your job in writing a mini essay for your seminar.
        Good luck!!
