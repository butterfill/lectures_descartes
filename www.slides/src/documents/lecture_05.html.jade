          Doubt  is necessary to establish ‘anything at all in the sciences that is stable and likely to last’
  .notes: :t
    Last week on Tuesday, I said the aim was to understand this.
    I suggested it was because doubt shows us that we 
    cannot know the essential nature of bodies by means of the senses.
    In explaining this, I contrasted two interpretations of Descartes’ position ...

    p.center Two Interpretations
  +left_half
    .hem-around-children
      p 1. The sciences need a metaphysical foundation.
      p 2. This foundation must include a refutation of scepticism.
  +right_half({step:true})
    .hem-around-children
      p 1. The assumption that sensory perception enables us to know the essential nature of things leads to bad science.
      p 2. Reflection on possible grounds for doubt provides reasons to reject this assumption.

    So the important thing about doubt is that it leads us away from the senses.

    I asked, Why does Descartes want to lead us away from the senses? 
    Because he sees this as they way to provide a foundation for his physics
    But we can’t be satisfied with this answer. We need to know why this is 
    relevant to Descates’ physics.

    I asked, Why does Descartes want to lead us away from the senses? 
    Because he sees this as they way to provide a foundation for his physics
    Then I asked, why does Descates’ physics require being led away?
    And the answer is because understanding Descartes’ physics
    requires recognising that the senses do not inform us about the 
    essential natural of material bodies.

      So how did Descartes answer his question?
    .slide
      p.indent Through reason alone.
    .slide
      p: :t
        ‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics; 
        these principles explain all natural phenomena, and enable us to provide quite certain demonstrations 
        regarding them’ (PP 2:64, CSM 1:247). 
    .notes Bennett Learning: ‘That plainly makes physics a part or a consequence of mathematics’

        p.em-above ‘the roots are Metaphysics’ : i.e. Descartes takes this epistemological claim to ground claims about the essential nature of things.
