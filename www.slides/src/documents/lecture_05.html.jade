          Doubt  is necessary to establish ‘anything at all in the sciences that is stable and likely to last’
  .notes: :t
    Last week on Tuesday, I said the aim was to understand this.
    I suggested it was because doubt shows us that we 
    cannot know the essential nature of bodies by means of the senses.
    In explaining this, I contrasted two interpretations of Descartes’ position ...

    In this lecture I want to go a little deeper ...

      p 1. The assumption that sensory perception enables us to know the essential nature of things leads to bad science.
      p 2. Reflection on possible grounds for doubt provides reasons to reject this assumption.

    \section{Error and The Wax}
    The claim that bodies are ‘not strictly perceived by the senses’ plays an essential
    role in Descartes account of error. Since the senses do not strictly perceive bodies,
    they cannot be the cause of errors about bodies.
