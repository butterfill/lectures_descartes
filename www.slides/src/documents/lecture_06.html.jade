  .notes: :t
    So how did Descartes answer his question?
  .slide
    p.em-above.indent Through reason alone.
  .slide
    p.em-above.notes.handout.show: :t
      ‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics; 
      these principles explain all natural phenomena, and enable us to provide quite certain demonstrations 
      regarding them’ 
    .notes.handout.ctd: :t
      \citep[p.~247, AT 2:64]{descartes:1985_csm1}

  .notes Bennett Learning: ‘That plainly makes physics a part or a consequence of mathematics’

  p.theQ How could reason alone enable us to know the essential nature of things?
  .step2.hide
    p.em-above: :t
      ‘I am certain that I am a thinking thing. 
    p: :t
      Do I not therefore also know what is required for my
      being certain about anything? 
    p: :t
      In this first item of knowledge there is simply a clear and
      distinct perception of what I am asserting; this would not be enough to make me certain of the
      truth of the matter if it could ever turn out that something which I perceived with such
      clarity and distinctness was false.’
  .slide
    p.em-above.notes.handout.show: :t
      ‘I now seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule that 
    p.notes.handout.show.ctd.whatever: :t
      whatever I perceive clearly and distinctly is true’

  p.hem-around: :t
    1. What are clear and distinct perceptions? 
  p.hem-around: :t
    2. Is a clear and distinct perception the perception of a claim for which there can be no grounds for withholding assent?
  p.hem-around: :t
    3. Why think clear and distinct perceptions only yield knowledge?
