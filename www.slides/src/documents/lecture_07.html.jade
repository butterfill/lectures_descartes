    I asked, Why does Descartes want to lead us away from the senses? 
    Because he sees this as they way to provide a foundation for his physics
    But we can’t be satisfied with this answer. We need to know why this is 
    relevant to Descates’ physics.

    I asked, Why does Descartes want to lead us away from the senses? 
    Because he sees this as they way to provide a foundation for his physics
    Then I asked, why does Descates’ physics require being led away?
    And the answer is because understanding Descartes’ physics
    requires recognising that the senses do not inform us about the 
    essential natural of material bodies.

    So Descartes didn’t just want to explain how we know the natures of things;
    he also thought that when we consider how we know them,
    we arrive at an entirely different view of the nature of the physcial world.

      ‘The whole of of Philosophy is like a tree, of which the roots are Metaphysics,
      the trunk is Physics, and the branches which come out of this trunk are all the
      other sciences ...’

    p Two interim conclusions
    p.em-above 1. The aims of The Meditations are ...
    p.em-above 2. The question How do we know? is linked to the question What are the essence natures of things?

      As I’ve been saying since the first lecture ...
      [new: doubt established the central claim about sensory perceptions]

      p.indent.main-claim Sensory perceptions provide only very obscure information about the essential nature of bodies.
      p.indent ∴ Not by treating sensory perceptions as a basis for judgements about them.

      The usefulness of extensive doubt ‘lies in freeing us from our preconceived opinions, 
      and providing the easiest route by which the mind may be led away from the senses.’

        p.em-above ‘the roots are Metaphysics’ : i.e. Descartes takes this epistemological claim to ground claims about the essential nature of things.
