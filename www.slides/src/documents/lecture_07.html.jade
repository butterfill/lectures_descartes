    I asked, Why does Descartes want to lead us away from the senses? 
    Because he sees this as they way to provide a foundation for his physics
    But we can’t be satisfied with this answer. We need to know why this is 
    relevant to Descates’ physics.

    I asked, Why does Descartes want to lead us away from the senses? 
    Because he sees this as they way to provide a foundation for his physics
    Then I asked, why does Descates’ physics require being led away?
    And the answer is because understanding Descartes’ physics
    requires recognising that the senses do not inform us about the 
    essential natural of material bodies.

  .notes: :t
    So Descartes didn’t just want to explain how we know the natures of things;
    he also thought that when we consider how we know them,
    we arrive at an entirely different view of the nature of the physcial world.

    p.em-above 2. The question How do we know? is linked to the question What are the essence natures of things?

      The usefulness of extensive doubt ‘lies in freeing us from our preconceived opinions,

        p.em-above ‘the roots are Metaphysics’ : i.e. Descartes takes this epistemological claim to ground claims about the essential nature of things.

    So how did Descartes answer his question?

      ‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics;

  p.center method: take only what is good, waste no time on flaws
  .notes: :t
    This is why we will not consider Descartes’ arguments for the existence of 
    god on this course, for example.  I can find nothing of value in them.
    Of course I might easily be wrong.
