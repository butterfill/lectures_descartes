  li The intellect is the sole source of error
  li.slide Thf. the senses do not represent
  li.slide Thf. there are no perceptual appearances 
    span.slide  ... and 
      span.false no representational momentum

  p: +knowledgeQuestion
  .notes: :t
    So how did Descartes answer his question?
  .slide
    p.em-above.indent Through the intellect alone.
  .slide
    p.em-above.notes.handout.show: :t
      ‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics; 
      these principles explain all natural phenomena, and enable us to provide quite certain demonstrations 
      regarding them’ 
    .notes.handout.ctd: :t
      \citep[p.~247, AT 2:64]{descartes:1985_csm1}
    p.right.grey-text Principles 
  .notes Bennett Learning: ‘That plainly makes physics a part or a consequence of mathematics’

  p: +knowledgeQuestion
  .notes: :t
    So here’s the question, as I keep saying.
  .slide
    p.em-above Negative part
    .notes Negative part: full marks to Descartes
    .hem-around-children
      p.indent.main-claim Sensory perceptions provide only very obscure information about the essential nature of bodies.
      p.indent ∴ Not by treating sensory perceptions as a basis for judgements about them.
  .slide
    .notes Positive part: descartes is just wrong
    p.em-above Positive part
    .hem-around-children
      p.indent.reason Through the intellect alone.

+slide_middle
  p.center method: take only what is good, waste no time on flaws
  .notes: :t
    This is why we will not consider Descartes’ arguments for the existence of 
    god on this course, for example.  I can find nothing of value in them.
    Of course I might easily be wrong.

  .notes: :t
    Closing fun ...
  p.notes.handout.show: :t
    ‘The [...] natural light [...] enables me to perceive that I would have given myself all the perfections of which I have an idea, if I had given myself existence’
  p.notes.handout.show.right.grey-text (Fourth Replies).
  .slide
    p.em-above.notes.handout.show: :t
      ‘the learned
      often employ distinctions so subtle that they disperse the natural light,
      and they detect obscurities even in matters which are perfectly clear to
      peasants’
  p.notes.handout.ctd: :t
    \citep[p.~59]{descartes:1985_csm1}
  p.right.grey-text (Rule 14).
