      Aim for this lecture is to understand why Descartes might say this.

  .notes: :t
    Let’s start with an easier question ... maybe if we understand what reasons Descartes 
    provides for doubt, we will understand better why doubt is necessary.

    How can the mere possibility that they might obtain give us grounds for doubt?

    How does this bear on our ultimate aim?

    .notes Perhaps this is a key idea ...

    p: :t
      obscure -> does not enable you to know you aren’t cosmically deceived
    p.slide: :t
      not obscure (clear?) -> does enable you to know you aren’t cosmically deceived
    p.slide: :t
      For all your sensory perceptions reveal, you are not in a position to know that you aren’t cosmically deceived
    p.slide: :t
      Therefore, sensory perceptions provide only 
      very obscure
      information about the essential nature of bodies.

    How close do you think this is to Descartes’ argument in Meditation 1?
    Can you do better

      p 1. The sciences need a metaphysical foundation.
      p 2. This foundation must include a refutation of scepticism.
  +right_half({step:true})
    .hem-around-children
      p 1. The assumption that sensory perception enables us to know the essential nature of things leads to bad science.
      p 2. Reflection on possible grounds for doubt provides reasons to reject this assumption.
