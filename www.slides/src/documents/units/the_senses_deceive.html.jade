  p (Separate from the_senses_puzzle because resolvable )
  p (Related to natural impulses)
  p (Further puzzle: if the senses do not represent, where do these ‘natural impulses’ come from?)

    Descartes is talking in the ordinary way, where
    such reasoning is ‘commonly assigned to the senses’
    He doesn’t really mean it.

    In the Sixth Meditation, Descates returns to the topic and appears to say that 
    the sense do deceive.

    ‘there may be some occurrence, not in the foot but in one of the other
    areas through which the nerves travel in their route from the foot to the
    brain, or even in the brain itself; and if this cause produces the same
    motion which is generally produced by injury to the foot, then pain will be
    felt as if it were in the foot. This deception of the senses is natural’

      Can we explain this away using the same strategy (ie its the third grade of 
      sensory response)?
