      p.slide form is, or determines, essence
      p.slide a body’s form directs its development and activity towards an end
      p.slide sensory perceptions resemble forms
      p.slide PS: the heavens are immutable (different physics)

    p.center Descartes
    .hem-around-children
      p.slide bodies composed of matter only
      p.slide bodies have a few simple properties (e.g. extension, motion)
      p.slide these properties explain all their sensory effects (e.g. heat, colour, taste)
      p.slide these properties are measurable on ratio scales

    So Descartes didn’t just want to explain how we know the natures of things;
    he also thought that when we consider how we know them,
    we arrive at an entirely different view of the nature of the physcial world.
