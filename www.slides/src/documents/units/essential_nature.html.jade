    (Descartes was a little unclear about his aim.
    This matters because we should evaluate his arguments against his aims.
    Same applies to you: always state your aim at the start of your essays.
    Now Descartes has an excuse: doing so might have caused his execution
    (and his works were put on the Index, etc).
    You don’t have any such excuse, at least not as far as I’m concerned.)

      p.slide these properties explain all their sensory effects (e.g. heat, colour, taste)
      p.slide these properties are measurable on ratio scales
