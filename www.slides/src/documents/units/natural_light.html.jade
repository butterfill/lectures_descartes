        ‘whatever is revealed to me by the natural light — for example that from the fact that I
        am doubting it follows that I exist, and so on — cannot in any way be open to doubt.
        This is because there cannot be another faculty both as trustworthy as the natural
        light and also capable of showing me that such things are not true.’

        ‘as for my natural impulses, I have often judged in the past that they were pushing me in the wrong direction when it
        was a question of choosing the good, and I do not see why I should place any greater confidence in them in other
        matters’
