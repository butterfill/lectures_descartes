      Unfortunately you cannot establish truths
      about the nature of external bodies
      on the basis of mathematics alone.
      At least not the kind of truths Descartes was interested in.
    .notes: :t
      Physics doesn’t reduce to mathematics.
      Although Descartes might have thought it would.
      After all, he was working in the very first moments of a new scientific approach.

      A puzzle on Descartes’ positive views about how we acquire knowledge of the essential
      natures of things.

      Descartes appears to hold that we have some kind of mathematical basis for 
      knowledge of the essential natures of bodies. But he is also an early proponent 
      of the importance of measurements. His scientific work all involves combining
      mathematics with observation. This is what led to the great breakthrough in science.

    p Hypothesis testing
    p.slide.hem-around 1. Sensory perception alone cannot tell you which hypothesis is true.
    p.slide.hem-around 2. Humans are disposed to accept many false hypotheses.
    .slide
      p.hem-above Therefore:
      p.hem-around 3. Your sensory perceptions and sense of what is plausible should not constrain which hypotheses you consider.
    p.slide.hem-around 4. ... but observation (sensory perception) is essential for testing hypotheses.
