      On my interpretation, Descartes is not offering an anti-sceptical argument.

      Steve’s rough idea:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item If we can know anything, then we can know God exists.
      \item We can know something.
      \item Therefore, we can know God exists.
      \item But God doesn’t deceive us.
      \item Therefore what we clearly perceive is true.
      \end{enumerate}
      Compare \citet{murdoch:1999_cartesian}: ‘not only is the doubt-insinuating thought not a reason 
      for Descartes to doubt his entitlement to infer that God exists, but also he has no other 
      reason to doubt this.’ Conflicting interpretations include \citet{rocca:2005_descartes,broughton:2003_descartes,doney:1955_cartesian}.

      p 1. The assumption that sensory perception enables us to know the essential nature of things leads to bad science.
      p 2. Reflection on possible grounds for doubt provides reasons to reject this assumption.
      .notes This is why doubt is necessary to establish anything in the sciences that is stable and likely to last.

    p If Descartes were refuting scepticism, the Cartesian Circle would be inescapable.

    ’an atheist can be clearly aware that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two 
    right angles [...]. But I maintain that this awareness of his is not 
    true knowledge, since no act of awareness that can be rendered doubtful seems 
    fit to be called knowledge’

    Also note what Descartes himself said ...
  .notes.handout: :t
    ‘as to the fact that I was not guilty of circularity when I said that the only
    reason we have for being sure that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is
    true is the fact that God exists, but that we are sure that God exists only
    because we perceive this clearly: [...] I made a distinction between what we in fact perceive
    clearly and what we remember having perceived clearly on a previous occasion.
    To begin with, we are sure that God exists because we attend to the arguments
    which prove this; but subsequently it is enough for us to remember that we
    perceived something clearly in order for us to be certain that it is true. This
    would not be sufficient if we did not know that God exists and is not a
    deceiver’
    \citep[p.~171, AT VII:245--6]{descartes:1985_csm2}
