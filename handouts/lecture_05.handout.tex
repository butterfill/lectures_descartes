\section{Descartes’ Aim in The Meditations}
 
‘these six meditations contain all the foundations of my physics.  But please do not tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of Aristotle to approve them.  I hope that readers will gradually get used to my principles, and recognize their truth,  before they notice that  they destroy the principles of Aristotle.’

\section{Aristotlians vs Descartes on the Essential Nature of Bodies}
 
‘these six meditations contain all the foundations of my physics.  But please do not tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of Aristotle to approve them.  I hope that readers will gradually get used to my principles, and recognize their truth,  before they notice that  they destroy the principles of Aristotle.’ 
 
‘in the whole history of physics up to now people have
only tried to imagine some causes to explain the phenomena of nature, with
virtually no success.
Compare my assumptions with the assumptions of others.
Compare all their real qualities, their substantial forms, their elements and
countless other such things
with 
my single assumption that 
all bodies are composed of parts’
(\citealp[p.~107]{descartes:1984_vol3} AT 2:199-200 quoted (with incorrect page number) by \citealp{sorell:2018_experimental}).
 
‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics;  these principles explain all natural phenomena, and enable us to provide quite certain demonstrations  regarding them’  
\citep[p.~247 AT 2:64]{descartes:1985_csm1}
 
‘The whole of of Philosophy is like a tree, of which the roots are Metaphysics,
the trunk is Physics, and the branches which come out of this trunk are all the
other sciences ...’
\citep[p.~186]{descartes:1985_csm1}

\section{Wax}
 
‘even bodies are not strictly perceived by the sense or the faculty of the imagination but by the
intellect alone’
(Meditation 2)
 
‘I can grasp that the wax is capable of countless changes, yet I am unable to run through this
immeasurable number of changes in my imagination… The nature of this piece of wax is in no way
revealed by my imagination, but is perceived by the mind alone’
(Meditation 2).
 
‘Something which I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of
judgement which is in my mind’
(Meditation 2).
