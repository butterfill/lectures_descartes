\section{Do the Senses Deceive?}
 
Sensory perceptions of tastes,
smells, sounds, heat, cold, light, colors and the like ‘do not represent
anything located outside our thought’
(\citealp[p.~ 219, AT VIII:35]{descartes:1985_csm1} cited by \citealp[p.~348]{simmons:1999_are})
 
‘from time to time I have found that the senses deceive’
\citep[p.~17, AT VII:18]{descartes:1985_csm2}
 
Sensory perceptions of tastes,
smells, sounds, heat, cold, light, colors and the like ‘do not represent
anything located outside our thought’
(\citealp[p.~ 219, AT VIII:35]{descartes:1985_csm1} cited by \citealp[p.~348]{simmons:1999_are})
 
‘from time to time I have found that the senses deceive’
\citep[p.~17, AT VII:18]{descartes:1985_csm2}
 
‘there may be some occurrence, not in the foot but in one of the other
areas through which the nerves travel in their route from the foot to the
brain, or even in the brain itself; and if this cause produces the same
motion which is generally produced by injury to the foot, then pain will be
felt as if it were in the foot. This deception of the senses is natural’
\citep[p.~61, AT VII:88]{descartes:1985_csm2}.
 
 
 
\section{Descartes’ Aim in The Meditations}
 
‘these six meditations contain all the foundations of my physics.  But please do not tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of Aristotle to approve them.  I hope that readers will gradually get used to my principles, and recognize their truth,  before they notice that  they destroy the principles of Aristotle.’ 
 
 
 
\section{Aristotelians vs Descartes on the Essential Nature of Bodies}

‘in the whole history of physics up to now people have
only tried to imagine some causes to explain the phenomena of nature, with
virtually no success.
Compare my assumptions with the assumptions of others.
Compare all their real qualities, their substantial forms, their elements and
countless other such things
with 
my single assumption that 
all bodies are composed of parts’
(\citealp[p.~107]{descartes:1984_vol3} AT 2:199-200 quoted (with incorrect page number) by \citealp{sorell:2018_experimental}).
 
‘The only principles which I accept or require in physics are those of geometry and pure mathematics;  these principles explain all natural phenomena, and enable us to provide quite certain demonstrations  regarding them’  
\citep[p.~247 AT 2:64]{descartes:1985_csm1}
